\subsection*{Algorithm description}

Let $x$ and $n$ be positive integer values,
and let $a_0 \ge \lfloor \sqrt[n]{x} \rfloor$ be
a starting guess\footnote{
  In PEP 572,
  the constraint for the starting guess is $a_0 \ge \sqrt[n]{x}$.
  The difference is subtle, but it's possible to notice,
  based on \eqref{ak-between-floor-and-root},
  that the only integer number
  that satisfy just one of these inequalities
  is itself the the desired result for the algorithm,
  a circumstance where the iterative process is expected to end,
  and the starting guess value $a_0$ itself is expected to be returned.
},
also integer and positive.
In order to find the value of $\lfloor \sqrt[n]{x} \rfloor$,
we're going to iteratively calculate the following sequence
while $a_k > d_{k+1}$:
\[
  d_{k+1} = \left\lfloor \dfrac{x}{a_k^{n-1}} \right\rfloor
\]
\[
  a_{k+1} = \left\lfloor \dfrac{(n-1) a_k + d_{k+1}}{n} \right\rfloor
\]
The result is the last $a_k$ value found in this process,
that is, the result is the value of $a_r$,
where $r$ is the smallest index for which $a_k \le d_{k+1}$ is valid.
