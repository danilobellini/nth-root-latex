\section*{A similar recurrence from the Newton-Raphson method}

In this section, a recurrence aiming to find
the value of $\sqrt[n]{x}$ without intermediary truncations
is presented.
In order to achieve this, a polynomial
and a sequence that converges to the root of this polynomial
are presented, as well as proof for this convergence.
The result is similar to the algorithm,
and it can be interpreted as a possible way of conjecturing it,
besides helping to understand it.
