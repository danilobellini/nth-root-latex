\section*{Abstract}

In PEP 572, there's an algorithm\footnote{
  \url{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/\#a-numeric-example}
}
implemented in Python with and without an \emph{assignment expression}
for obtaining the $n$-th root of $x$,
using only integer numbers (input, output and in-between values),
where the final result is the truncated value of the desired root
if it's not an integer.
The purpose of this text is to explain, justify, prove and analyze
this algorithm and how it works.
