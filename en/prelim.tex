\section*{Preliminary considerations}

For proper understanding
of analyzes and proofs throughout this text,
prior knowledge is required on elementary mathematics, sets,
powers, roots, absolute value, summations, pi product notation,
order relations and their properties,
proofs (direct, contraposition, induction, contradiction,
        cases separation),
as well as a minimum of differential calculus on a real variable.
The rest of the mathematical requirements for understanding the text
are presented as follows.

PEP 572 provides two \emph{hints}
for proving the algorithm's correctness:
\textsc{(i)} the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means,
and \textsc{(ii)} the properties of floor functions nesting.
Concerning the second item,
there's no information on which are those properties,
except they're not trival.
Explanations on these topics,
including proofs of properties that are required
or somehow linked to the algorithm under analysis,
are in this section of the text.

The rest of this section is divided by topic.
We'll briefly analyze matters related
to positive numbers,
to floor and ceiling functions,
to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means,
and to the convergence of sequences of real numbers.
