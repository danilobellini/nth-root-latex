\subsection*{Positive numbers}

In order to avoid possible ambiguities
related to notation distinctions for different authors,
it's worth noting that, in the context of this text,
the set of natural numbers $\mathds{N}$ include the zero,
the set of positive integer numbers is
$\mathds{N}^* = \mathds{N} \setminus \{0\}$,
and the set of positive real numbers is
$\mathds{R}^+ =
 \{\gamma: \gamma > 0 \text{ e } \gamma \in \mathds{R}\}$.

A relevant result from comparing integer numbers
consists of using the unit ``step''
for converting between strict and non-strict inequalities.
Given $m \in \mathds{Z}$, we know that $m > 0 \iff m \ge 1$,
that is, $1$ is the infimum of the set of positive integers.
Substituting $m$ for a difference of integers $m = \ell - k$ gives:
\begin{equation}\label{int+1}
  k < \ell \iff k + 1 \le \ell,
  \quad \forall k \in \mathds{Z}, \; \forall \ell \in \mathds{Z}
\end{equation}
