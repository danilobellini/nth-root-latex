\subsection*{Algorithm implementation in Python}

The proposed algorithm can be written in Python
using an \emph{assignment expression}\footnote{
  An expression performing an assignment.
  This syntax with the ``\texttt{:=}'' (\emph{walrus}) operator
  is available from Python 3.8 onward.
}:

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}{7cm}
    \inputminted{python}{nth_root.py}
  \end{minipage}
\end{center}

Apart from whitespaces,
the last $3$ lines of this algorithm
consist exactly of the code snippet that appears in PEP 572.
The first line just defines a block as a \emph{function},
with the meaning that the word has
in the sense how this word is used
in the context of programming languages.
The second line defines a specific initial value,
a novelty of this text, something not included in PEP 572.
